## Installing and Running

Install all deps using `npm`; `npm install` should work.

Then, to run do a simple `npm run dev`. This will run: 

* A frontend at http://localhost:9000
* A WebSocket Server at ws://localhost:8090

And navigate to the "Simple Editor".

Then, open up two browsers and start playing.
